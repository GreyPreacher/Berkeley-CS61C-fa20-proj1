# Berkeley CS61C fall20 project1 game of life
ðŸ‘‘ This is the Berkeley CS61C **Great Ideas in Computer Architecture** fall 2020 project1 game of life by GreyPreacher(Alvin Zhang). I have completed the project on Dec 1, 2022.
**IMPORTANT: This repository is discarded due to venus incompatibility, I decide to abandon CS61C fa20 and to finish CS61C sp22 instead.**  
You can reach my sp22 edition in [this page](https://github.com/GreyPreacher/Berkeley-CS61C).
